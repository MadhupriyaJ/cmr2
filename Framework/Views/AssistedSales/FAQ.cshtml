                                        <p>The International Bank ACCOUNT Number (IBAN) has been introduced to standardize the identification of bank ACCOUNTS. It is essential to understand the following points regarding IBAN:</p>
                                        <p>he IBAN is not a new ACCOUNT number. Existing ACCOUNT numbers will be replaced with additional prefix and calculated checksum characters will appear in front of existing bank ACCOUNT numbers. The original bank account number, plus the additional characters, will be known as the IBAN. Implementing the IBAN system will help improve the quality of information exchanged between banks both within in Qatar and internationally. Its reliability and accuracy will reduce error and delays.</p>
